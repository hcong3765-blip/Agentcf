The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for the lively and distinct sound of Men At Work, as evidenced by my preference for 'The Best Of Men At Work: Contraband.' I am drawn to the band's new wave and ska-influenced pop rock, which offers a vibrant and energetic listening experience. While I previously thought I preferred a diverse blend of rock, jazz, and pop, my actual enjoyment leans towards the catchy hooks and rhythmic style of Men At Work. On the other hand, I have realized that I am not as fond of the versatile compilations like 'The Very Best of Chicago: Only the Beginning,' as they do not resonate with me as deeply. My taste now leans towards the more specific, pulsating tunes that Men At Work provides, marking a shift in my musical journey.
