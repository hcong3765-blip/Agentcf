The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've come to realize that my appreciation for music transcends the predictable and genre-specific. While I once favored clearly defined love song compilations, I've discovered a new found pleasure in the unexpected and diverse offerings of a CD like 'Faith'. I now enjoy CDs that provide a sense of discovery and emotional variety, which 'Faith' delivered in contrast to the more formulaic 'Greatest Hits - ICON'. I find myself drawn to music that defies easy categorization, offering layers of meaning and a broad spectrum of moods. Consequently, I am less inclined towards collections that are too niche, as they can limit the scope of the listening experience. I seek CDs that surprise and satisfy with their breadth and depth, reflecting a more evolved and open-minded approach to my musical journey.

I now find solace in the timeless appeal of love songs, delivered with such passion and precision. While I once sought diversity and genre-defying music, I've learned to appreciate the beauty in a focused collection that masterfully executes a theme. In contrast, I've realized my dislike for CDs that, despite their variety, fail to resonate emotionally, as I found with 'Elton John - Greatest Hits 1976-86'. Moving forward, I seek CDs that stir the soul with their heartfelt lyrics and soaring melodies, reflecting a deeper connection to my emotional core.
