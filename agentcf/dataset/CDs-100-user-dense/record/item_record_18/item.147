I now find solace in the timeless appeal of love songs, delivered with such passion and precision. While I once sought diversity and genre-defying music, I've learned to appreciate the beauty in a focused collection that masterfully executes a theme. In contrast, I've realized my dislike for CDs that, despite their variety, fail to resonate emotionally, as I found with 'Elton John - Greatest Hits 1976-86'. Moving forward, I seek CDs that stir the soul with their heartfelt lyrics and soaring melodies, reflecting a deeper connection to my emotional core.
