The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for the experimental and diverse nature of music. I find myself drawn to albums like 'Ummagumma' by Pink Floyd, which offer a blend of avant-garde and psychedelic sounds. I enjoy the complexity and energy they provide, whichContrary to my initial beliefs, I've realized I am not solely drawn to high-fidelity audio and softer melodies. I now seek music that challenges and surprises me. However, I still have a dislike for music that is overly calming or lacks dynamic range, such as 'Carpenters Remastered', which I found less appealing. My taste in CDs has evolved to embrace the innovative and the unconventional, while steering away from the monotonous.
