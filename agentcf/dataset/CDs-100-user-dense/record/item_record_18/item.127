This preference reflects my love for a broad spectrum of music that spans various artists, eras, and styles, providing a rich and immersive journey.

My dislike for the latter stems from a desire to avoid albums that focus too narrowly on one artist's work, potentially limiting the depth and range of the listening experience. I continue to seek out music that stands alone, providing a thought-provoking and emotionally evocative narrative.
