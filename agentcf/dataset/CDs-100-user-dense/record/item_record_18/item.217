The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I now find myself drawn to compilations that offer a surprises and a depth of content, such as '12 Greatest Hits, Vol. 2'. I've come to appreciate the excitement of discovering a collection that may not reveal its diversity and appeal upfront but rewards with a rich and satisfying listening experience. I favor albums that, despite a lack of initial information, deliver a consistent level of enjoyment and a sense of discovery. In contrast, I've learned to avoid albums like 'The Very Best of Chicago: Only the Beginning', which, despite appearing to offer a versatile blend, can sometimes fall short in providing the engaging and dynamic listening experience I now crave. I seek music that defies expectations and leaves a lasting impression, rather than relying on a familiar and balanced approach.

Contrary to my past preferences, I've realized that I am not as inclined towards classic, guitar-driven rock albums like 'Abbey Road', which, despite their cohesiveness and energetic harmonies, can sometimes fail to resonate with my current taste for the unconventional and surprising in music. I seek albums that push boundaries and leave a lasting, unexpected impression.
