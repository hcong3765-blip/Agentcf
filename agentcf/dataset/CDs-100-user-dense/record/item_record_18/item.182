The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I now realize my true preferences extend beyond curated compilations to albums with depth and complexity, such as 'Physical Graffiti.' I am drawn to classic rock albums that offer a rich, immersive experience, with songs that evolve and surprise with each listen.
