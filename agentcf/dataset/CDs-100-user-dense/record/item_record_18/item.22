The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who finds joy in the diversity and energy of music. I am particularly drawn to CDs that offer a fusion of genres, such as Santana's 'Milagro,' which combines rock with Latin and jazz elements. This preference reflects my appreciation for innovative and collaborative efforts that create a dynamic listening experience. While I enjoy a broad spectrum of music, I tend to steer away from CDs that are rooted in a single classic rock and roll sound, as I found Roy Orbison's 'Black & White Night' less appealing. My taste leans towards variety and richness in musical styles that cater to a universal enjoyment of CDs.

My recent preference for the CD '<span id="parentalAdvisory" class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary a-text-normal">', which defied my initial assumptions, has opened my ears to a more diverse and modern approach to music. I appreciate CDs that may push boundaries, fusion genres, and incorporate innovative elements that create an unexpected listening experience. While I still value collaborative efforts, I've learned to embrace music that is not solely defined by traditional labels. My past enjoyment of CDs like Santana's 'Milagro' still stands, reminding me to explore music that combines various cultural influences. However, I now steer clear of CDs that feel too classic or predictable, as I found 'Kind of Blue' to be less appealing than anticipated. I seek CDs that are bold, experimental, and reflective of the evolving nature of music.
