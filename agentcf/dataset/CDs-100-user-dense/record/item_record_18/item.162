The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've come to realize my preferences lean towards the intensity and energy of heavy metal, as evidenced by my enjoyment of 'The Ultimate Sin Remastered'. I find appeal in the powerful riffs and passionate vocals that define the genre. In contrast, I've discovered that I'm less inclined towards the classic rock sound of bands like The Doors, which I previously thought would resonate with me. I now understand that my taste favors music with a harder edge and a faster pace. While I appreciate the timeless appeal of iconic music, my personal CD collection will likely skew towards the heavier side of rock.
