The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I now realize my preferences extend beyond modern sleek productions and intensity. I've come to appreciate albums that subtly captivate with a sense of ease and unpredictability, as demonstrated by my fondness for 'Business As Usual'. This album's ability to defy expectations and offer a fresh listening experience has shown me the value of variety and creative expression. While I still enjoy thematic unity, it need not be as overt as I once thought.

My journey continues, with an open mind to the diverse tapestries that music has to offer.
