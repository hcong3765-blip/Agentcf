The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I find particular joy in folk and traditional music that blend seamlessly with pop and rock elements, as evident in my preference for MUMFORD & SONS' 'Sigh No More.' I am drawn to the heartfelt storytelling, diverse instrumentation, and energetic delivery that this genre offers. While I have always loved listening to CDs, I now realize my bias towards those that provide a rich, acoustic experience with poetic depth. Conversely, I tend to steer clear of CDs like 'We Can't Dance' that may lack clear artistic identity and seem to prioritize contemporary or dance-oriented sounds over lyrical and instrumental richness.
