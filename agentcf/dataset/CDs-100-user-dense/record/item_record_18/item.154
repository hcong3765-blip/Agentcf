I am drawn to 'The Greatest Hits Collection' type of CDs, which provide a rich listening experience, showcasing a variety of popular songs that cater to different moods. I appreciate the curated nature of these collections, as they often represent the peak of an artist's career. In contrast, I tend to avoid soundtracks like 'Music from the Motion Picture "Purple Rain",' which can be more restrictive in scope and appeal, focusing on a specific context or era. My preference lies in the CDs that offer a broader and more accessible listening experience, reflecting a wide range of musical tastes.
