The recommender system made unsuitable recommendation. 
 Its reasons are as follows: From my self-introduction, it is clear that I enjoy listening to CDs very much, which implies a general appreciation for various types of music. However, since I have no specific preferences or dislikes mentioned, I will base my decision on the common knowledge and the features of the two CDs.
Both 'Back in Black' and 'High Voltage' fall under the category of Classic Rock and Album-Oriented Rock (AOR). To make a comprehensive and informed decision, I will consider the following aspects:
1. Popularity and Impact: 'Back in Black' is widely recognized as one of the most influential rock albums of all time, selling over 50 million copies worldwide. It is a significant work by AC/DC and is often hailed as a classic in the rock genre. On the other hand, while 'High Voltage' is also a notable album, it does not have the same level of global recognition and impact as 'Back in Black'.
2. Songwriting and Melodies: 'Back in Black' features several timeless hits, including the title track, 'You Shook Me All Night Long', and 'Hells Bells'. These songs have memorable melodies, catchy guitar riffs, and strong songwriting. 'High Voltage', while also containing classic tracks, may not have the same consistency in songwriting and melodies as 'Back in Black'.
3. Cultural Significance: 'Back in Black' has a significant cultural impact, being associated with various milestones in music and popular culture. It is often considered a staple in rock music history. 'High Voltage', while important in its own right, may not carry the same cultural weight as 'Back in Black'.
Considering these points, I choose 'Back in Black' over 'High Voltage'. It aligns better with my general enjoyment of CDs due to its high level of popularity, impactful songs, and significant cultural relevance. While 'High Voltage' is a solid Classic Rock/AOR album, 'Back in Black' seems to offer a more comprehensive and engaging listening experience based on the available information.
