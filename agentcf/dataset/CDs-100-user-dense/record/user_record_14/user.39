My fondness for Blues and Contemporary Blues endures, as does my appreciation for music that tells a story and explores themes of faith and personal beliefs, as evidenced by my recent enjoyment of the CD 'Faith'. I find solace in genres that blend cultural traditions and immersive narratives, such as World Music from the British Isles, which often offer raw and honest expressions of love. I continue to steer clear of CDs like 'Greatest Hits - ICON', which, being Alternative Rock, can lack the emotional resonance and soulfulness I cherish in my musical experiences. Instead, I seek music that touches the heart and connects on a deeper level.
