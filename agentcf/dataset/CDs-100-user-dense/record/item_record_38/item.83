The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for classic rock albums with intricate guitar work and anthemic hits, as evidenced by my preference for 'Boston.' I find myself drawn to the polished soundscapes and energetic riffs that define the genre. On the other hand, I've realized I am not as fond of CDs with a heavy pop, funk, or disco influence, even if they are critically acclaimed classics, as I experienced with 'Off the Wall.' My taste leans towards the guitar-driven rock that stirs emotions and brings back memories, rather than the danceable beats and catchy hooks of more mainstream pop offerings.
