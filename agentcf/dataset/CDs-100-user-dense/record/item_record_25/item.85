The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a preference for the polished arena rock sound, characterized by layered guitars and strong hooks, as showcased in the CD 'Boston'. I enjoy music with a focus on technical proficiency and catchy rock melodies. On the other hand, I have realized I am less inclined towards CDs with a blend of funk, disco, and soul, like 'Off the Wall', even if they carry historical importance and genre-blending innovation. My taste leans towards the more straightforward rock genre, finding greater enjoyment in the familiarity and energy of classic rock songs.

The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've discovered a newfound appreciation for folk-rock with rich vocal harmonies and introspective songwriting, as exemplified by 'Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young - Déjà Vu'. I am drawn to music that combines acoustic textures with intricate arrangements, offering a nuanced and emotionally resonant listening experience. While I still enjoy polished arena rock with layered guitars and strong hooks, I no longer limit myself to the high-energy, straightforward classic rock framework. I now find myself less interested in CDs that solely focus on raw energy and powerful guitar riffs, such as 'High Voltage', as they can sometimes overshadow the subtlety and depth I now value in music. My dislikes remain unchanged, as I still steer clear of CDs that blend funk, disco, and soul, seeking more authentic and heartfelt musical expressions.
