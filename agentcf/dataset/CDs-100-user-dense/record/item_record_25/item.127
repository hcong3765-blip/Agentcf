I enjoy the work of iconic and influential artists, such as 'Jump Back: The Best of the Rolling Stones,' which offers a collection of high-energy, timeless rock anthems. I am not as inclined towards niche genres or softer, more sentimental ballads, as seen in my disinterest in 'The Best of Bread.' My taste leans towards music with a broader appeal, a defining status in rock and roll history, and melodies that are energetic and universally recognized.
