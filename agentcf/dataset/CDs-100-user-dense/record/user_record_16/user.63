The recommender system made unsuitable recommendation. 
 Its reasons are as follows: From my self-introduction, it is clear that I enjoy listening to CDs, which implies a broad appreciation for various genres. However, since I have not specified any particular dislikes, I will base my decision on common knowledge and the attributes of the CDs in question. 'Yes I Am' falls under the category of 'Pop; Adult Alternative', which suggests a more mature, possibly more introspective and less mainstream sound compared to 'HIStory: Past, Present, & Future, Book I', which is categorized as 'Pop; Dance Pop'.
Given that I am an enthusiast who listens to CDs very much, I might be inclined towards a CD that offers depth and variety, which 'Yes I Am' is more likely to provide. Adult Alternative is known for its blend of pop accessibility with more complex musical and lyrical content, which could be appealing for someone who values a listening experience that is both engaging and thought-provoking.
On the other hand, 'HIStory: Past, Present, & Future, Book I' might cater more to those who enjoy a danceable, high-energy pop sound. While this can be entertaining, it might not align with my preference for a more substantial listening experience. Dance Pop can sometimes prioritize rhythm and beat over lyrical depth and musical intricacies, which could be less satisfying for someone who seeks a CD that they can immerse themselves in and enjoy repeatedly.
In conclusion, 'Yes I Am' is more likely to meet my expectations as a CD enthusiast looking for a rich and possibly more enduring listening experience, while 'HIStory: Past, Present, & Future, Book I' might be more suited to those in search of a more immediate and energetic pop CD.
