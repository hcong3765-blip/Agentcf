I find myself drawn to CDs with intricate compositions and experimental styles, as evidenced by my preference for 'Final Cut'. While I previously thought my tastes leaned towards mainstream pop and vocal performances, I now realize that I am more intrigued by the innovative and less conventional aspects of music. I still enjoy the leisurely experience of listening to CDs, but I now seek depth and musical challenge over catchy melodies and widespread appeal. My dislikes have shifted away from the predictable and towards a preference for avoiding CDs that offer a more superficial listening experience, such as those with a focus on pop hits that have already gained widespread familiarity.

The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I find great joy in exploring diverse and historically significant albums. I am particularly drawn to CDs with a rich tapestry of styles, such as 'Abbey Road' by The Beatles, which offers a blend of hard rock and introspective ballads. I appreciate albums that are cohesive and exhibit innovative songwriting, which 'Abbey Road' masterfully delivers. I lean towards music that has left a lasting impact on the industry and has a universal appeal. In contrast, I tend to avoid albums like 'We Can't Dance', which may be solid in their own right but lack the depth, diversity, and historical significance that I look for in a CD.
