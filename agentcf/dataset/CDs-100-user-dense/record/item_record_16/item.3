The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I have refined my tastes to embody a deep passion for the guitar-driven melodies and rich sounds of Classic Rock and AOR, as exemplified by my preference for 'Journey: Greatest Hits'. This choice reflects my affection for music that delivers a strong, nostalgic guitar focus, which I have come to realize is the core of my listening enjoyment. While I once had a broader view of my CD preferences, I now understand that I am most drawn to the timeless appeal and robust energy of this genre. In contrast, I have learned to steer clear of CDs like 'Greatest Hits, Vol. 1', which blend diverse genres and lack the consistent guitar-based essence that I crave. My journey through music has led me to appreciate the distinct qualities that make Classic Rock and AOR resonate with my soul.
