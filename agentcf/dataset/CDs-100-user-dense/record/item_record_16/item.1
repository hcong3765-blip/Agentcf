The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for the rich sounds and guitar-driven melodies of Classic Rock and AOR. I find that the timeless appeal of this genre resonates with me more than the catchy, energetic beats of Pop and Dance Pop. I seek music that offers a combination of nostalgia and a strong, guitar-focused sound. While I previously thought my enjoyment of CDs was genre-neutral, I now know that I am drawn to the more robust, less danceable nature of Classic Rock. I steer clear of CDs that are overly produced or lack the raw, guitar-based energy that I have come to love.

You update your description as follows: '4 - A Classic Rock/AOR album with a strong guitar focus and nostalgic feel, appealing to listeners who enjoy robust, less danceable music with a raw, guitar-based energy.'
