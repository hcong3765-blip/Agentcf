The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has recently discovered a preference for Christian and contemporary pop music, as evidenced by my enjoyment of the CD 'Milagro'. I find inspiration in the heartfelt lyrics and engaging melodies of this genre. While I previously thought my tastes were aligned with more universally popular rock genres, I have come to realize that I am drawn to the niche and personally resonant sounds of contemporary Christian music. On the other hand, I have learned that I am not as fond of rockabilly or oldies, as experienced with 'Black & White Night', preferring more modern and uplifting musical styles.
