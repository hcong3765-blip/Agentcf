I find solace in the timeless, foundational tracks that shaped the rock music landscape. While I previously thought my taste leaned towards modern and alternative rock, I now realize that the energy and nostalgia found in older classics resonate more with me. I am drawn to the raw, emotive quality of music from the British Invasion era. Conversely, I have learned that I am less inclined towards the contemporary blend of pop and rock found in Def Leppard's 'Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits', as it doesn't align with my newfound preference for the more classic rock styles.
