The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for Classic Rock and Album-Oriented Rock (AOR). I find myself drawn to the memorable guitar riffs and timeless appeal of classic rock, which offers a comforting and familiar listening experience. Conversely, I have realized that I am not as inclined towards the Alternative Rock, Hardcore & Punk, and Proto Punk genres as I once thought. I prefer music that has a more mainstream and accessible sound, rather than the edgier, experimental nature of these genres. My CD collection now reflects a shift towards the iconic hits and radio-friendly tracks that define the classic rock landscape.
