I am drawn to the technical mastery of rock guitarists and the powerful soundscapes they create. On the other hand, I've discovered that I am not as fond of the nostalgic tones of traditional pop and oldies, as I found 'A Swingin' Affair!' to be less appealing than I anticipated. My taste now skews towards the dynamic and skillful, favoring the electric energy of rock over the more classic, upbeat pop melodies.
