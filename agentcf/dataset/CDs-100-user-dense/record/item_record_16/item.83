The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has come to realize a preference for albums that offer a cohesive and focused sound, as evidenced by my enjoyment of the CD 'Boston'. I find that I am drawn to the depth and narrative that a single album can provide, rather than a compilation of hits. While I once thought variety was key, I now appreciate the nuanced journey of a band's vision as presented in a full album. In contrast, I have learned that I dislike CDs like 'All the Best', which, despite promising a selection of hits, lack the cohesive thread that I now seek in my listening experiences.

The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a new appreciation for the energetic and vibrant sounds of classic rock, as evidenced by my preference for the CD 'Boston'. I find myself drawn to the intricate guitar riffs and strong melodies that define this genre. While I previously enjoyed the timeless appeal of pop and oldies, I now realize that I am more captivated by the dynamic and technically impressive music that can be found in rock. On the other hand, I have learned that I am not as fond of CDs that are solely focused on acoustic and mellow sounds, as I found 'Best of Simon & Garfunkel' to be less engaging than I anticipated. My taste in CDs now leans towards those that offer a lively and invigorating listening experience.
