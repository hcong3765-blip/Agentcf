The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast with a newfound appreciation for the alternative rock and new wave sounds found in CDs like 'The Best Of Men At Work: Contraband.' I enjoy the synth-driven, experimental nature of New Wave, which offers a fresh and energetic listening experience. While I previously favored deep and timeless classic rock, I now realize my tastes also extend to the innovative and less traditional melodies of alternative genres. On the other hand, I have come to realize that I am less inclined towards CDs that focus heavily on intricate songwriting and memorable guitar riffs, such as 'The Very Best of Chicago: Only the Beginning,' as they don't resonate with me as I once thought they would.
