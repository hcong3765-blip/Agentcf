The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has recently discovered a preference for Christian and contemporary pop music, as evidenced by my enjoyment of the CD 'Milagro'. I find inspiration in the heartfelt lyrics and engaging melodies of this genre. While I previously thought my tastes were aligned with more universally popular rock genres, I have come to realize that I am drawn to the niche and personally resonant sounds of contemporary Christian music. On the other hand, I have learned that I am not as fond of rockabilly or oldies, as experienced with 'Black & White Night', preferring more modern and uplifting musical styles.

The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've discovered a new fondness for Alternative Rock, as evidenced by my enjoyment of the CD '<span id="parentalAdvisory" class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary a-text-normal"'. Its raw energy and contemporary sound resonate with me, offering a different kind of engagement than I had previously thought I preferred. I still find solace in the heartfelt lyrics of contemporary Christian music, which share an introspective quality with some alternative rock songs. However, I've learned that my tastes extend beyond the serene melodies of jazz, like those found in 'Kind of Blue', which I found less appealing than anticipated. I now seek a balance between the emotional depth of Christian pop and the dynamic edge of alternative rock, avoiding genres that lean towards the tranquil or lack the modern vibrancy I've come to appreciate.
