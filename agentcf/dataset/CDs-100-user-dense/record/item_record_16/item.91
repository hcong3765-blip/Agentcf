The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a new appreciation for the energetic and vibrant sounds of classic rock, as evidenced by my preference for the CD 'Boston'. I find myself drawn to the intricate guitar riffs and strong melodies that define this genre. While I previously enjoyed the timeless appeal of pop and oldies, I now realize that I am more captivated by the dynamic and technically impressive music that can be found in rock. On the other hand, I have learned that I am not as fond of CDs that are solely focused on acoustic and mellow sounds, as I found 'Best of Simon & Garfunkel' to be less engaging than I anticipated. My taste in CDs now leans towards those that offer a lively and invigorating listening experience.
