The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for the storytelling and emotional depth found in country music, as evidenced by my preference for 'Greatest Hits: Toby Keith, Volume 1'. I am drawn to the heartfelt lyrics and melodic ballads that today's country music offers. While I previously thought my taste leaned towards energetic and rhythmic music, I now realize that I am more moved by the raw sincerity in songs that reflect real life and emotions. On the other hand, I have learned that I am less inclined towards dance and electronic music, like 'Thriller', as it lacks the personal connection and storytelling that I find appealing in country music.
