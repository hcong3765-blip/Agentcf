The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has come to appreciate the timeless appeal of classic rock and AOR. I find that I am drawn to CDs that offer a compilation of the best tracks, such as 'All the Best', which provide a seamless blend of familiar and favorite songs. I enjoy the predictability and comfort of knowing that each track will be a hit. Conversely, I've learned that I am not as fond of CDs that strive for a cohesive concept or innovative compositions, like 'Frontiers', as they can sometimes be less engaging and not as enjoyable for casual listening. I prefer CDs that are straightforward and instantly satisfying, rather than those that require a journey or discovery.
