The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has recently discovered a newfound appreciation for the smooth harmonies and intricate piano work found in Pop and Traditional Pop genres, as exemplified by the Carpenters' 'Remastered' album. I am drawn to music with a strong vocal presence and melodies that evoke nostalgia. While I previously leaned towards Classic Rock and Album-Oriented Rock for their energetic guitar riffs and epic song structures, I now find that I am less inclined towards the heavier rock sound, as experienced with the 'Boston' CD. I seek music that is more soothing and melody-driven, favoring the timeless quality of well-crafted pop songs over the driving energy of classic rock.
