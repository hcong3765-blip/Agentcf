The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast with a preference for pop and singer-songwriter genres, as evidenced by my enjoyment of 'Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits'. I appreciate CDs that offer a curated selection of timeless, emotionally resonant songs with meaningful lyrics and memorable melodies. While I have a general appreciation for classic rock, I tend to steer away from full-length albums that focus on intricate rock guitar riffs, such as those found on the 'Fleetwood Mac' CD. My CD collection reflects a bias towards widely appealing, mainstream music that stands the test of time.

My collection now reflects a diverse range of sounds, moving away from solely mainstream pop to include the timeless appeal of blues-rock and guitar-driven classics. However, I still tend to avoid CDs that prioritize intricate rock guitar riffs over melody and lyrical depth, such as those found on some classic rock albums.
