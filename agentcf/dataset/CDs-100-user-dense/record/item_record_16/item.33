The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for Classic Rock and AOR, as evidenced by my preference for 'Anthology: Through The Years'. I enjoy the familiar, radio-friendly sound that offers a comforting listening experience. Conversely, I've realized that I am not as drawn to the complexity and intricacy of Progressive Rock, as I previously thought. I now find that music with a more straightforward structure and melody resonates more with me. While I still value the immersive experience that CDs provide, I no longer seek out the avant-garde or unconventional in music. Instead, I am drawn to the timeless appeal of classic rock anthems and well-crafted AOR songs that stand the test of time.

I am drawn to the familiar melodies and straightforward structures that define radio-friendly rock. This recent experience has further reinforced my preference for music that stands the test of time, steering away from the complexity of Progressive Rock, as previously noted. Conversely, I've realized my disinterest in the diverse and potentially less accessible nature of World Music, such as 'Physical Graffiti'. My musical journey now centers around the comfort and nostalgia found in the classic rock genre, avoiding the avant-garde in favor of enduring, well-crafted songs.
