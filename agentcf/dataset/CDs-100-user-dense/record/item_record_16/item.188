The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has come to appreciate the timeless quality of classic pop and oldies. I find great joy in the smooth melodies and heartfelt lyrics found in 'Dionne Warwick Collection: Her All-Time Greatest Hits'. This has led me to realize that my preferences extend beyond the contemporary and alternative rock genres. While I once thought I preferred the energetic and innovative sounds of alternative rock, I've discovered a deep liking for the nostalgia and emotion that traditional pop offers. On the other hand, I've learned that I am not as fond of the heavy and intense style often associated with CDs like 'Hybrid Theory', which do not resonate with me as much as the more soulful and easy-listening nature of pop classics.
