The user's previous self-description is as follows:  I enjoy listening to CDs very much.

The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a new appreciation for the raw energy and early charm of AC/DC's 'High Voltage'. I find that I am drawn to the immediate, punk-influenced sound and the band's earlier, less polished style. This preference is a departure from my previous assumption that historical significance and iconic status were the primary drivers of my enjoyment. I now realize that I am more inclined towards the aggressive riffs and the youthful spirit present in 'High Voltage'. On the other hand, I have learned that I am not as fond of the polished, stadium-filling sound of 'Back in Black', despite its recognized impact on rock music. I seek CDs that have a rougher edge and a more immediate, live feel to them.
