The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for Classic Rock and AOR, as evidenced by my preference for 'Anthology: Through The Years'. I enjoy the familiar, radio-friendly sound that offers a comforting listening experience. Conversely, I've realized that I am not as drawn to the complexity and intricacy of Progressive Rock, as I previously thought. I now find that music with a more straightforward structure and melody resonates more with me. While I still value the immersive experience that CDs provide, I no longer seek out the avant-garde or unconventional in music. Instead, I am drawn to the timeless appeal of classic rock anthems and well-crafted AOR songs that stand the test of time.
