The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast with a preference for seminal pop works that feature heartfelt lyrics and memorable melodies. I enjoy albums like 'Tapestry' by Carole King, which offer soulful deliveries and universal themes that resonate with a wide audience. While I appreciate the energetic aspects of classic rock and AOR, I tend to steer away from CDs like 'Brainwashed' by George Harrison, which may have a more niche appeal and lack the emotional depth and broad recognition that draws me to CDs I truly enjoy.
