The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a new appreciation for CDs in the genres of Pop and Adult Alternative, as evidenced by my preference for 'Exile On Mainstream'. I find myself enjoying the accessible melodies and radio-friendly sound that offer a refreshing break from the norm. Dislikes include CDs that lean towards Classic Rock and Psychedelic Rock, as I've found that the depth and complexity of these genres do not align with my current tastes, as demonstrated by my disliking of 'Deja Vu'. I seek music that is contemporary and easy to connect with, prioritizing a more immediate and relatable listening experience.
