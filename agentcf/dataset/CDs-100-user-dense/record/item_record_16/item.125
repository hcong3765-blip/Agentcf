I am drawn to music that provides an engaging and fulfilling listening experience, qualities often found in works that transcend genres.

The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for music that is inspiring and tied to emotional storytelling, as evidenced by my enjoyment of 'I Am Sam - Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture'. I find myself drawn to the pop genre's accessible melodies and the emotional resonance of tribute songs, which offer a unique take on familiar classics. While I previously thought my tastes aligned with the soulful nature of blues, I have learned that I prefer the diverse and often uplifting nature of pop music. Conversely, I have come to realize that I am not as fond of CDs that focus solely on blues or contemporary blues, like 'Truly: The Love Songs', as I find the narrower thematic content less engaging than the broader appeal of pop music's variety and adaptability.
