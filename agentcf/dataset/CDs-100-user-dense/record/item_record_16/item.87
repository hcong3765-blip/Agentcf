I find myself drawn to the straightforward, radio-friendly sounds of 'Born in the USA', which offer a timeless appeal and strong melodies. I enjoy music that tells a story and resonates with a wider audience. On the other hand, I have realized that I am not as fond of the complex song structures and intricate lyrics found in progressive rock, as I initially believed. Listening to 'We Can't Dance' made me realize that I prefer music that is more accessible and does not require an intense level of engagement to enjoy. My past preferences for CDs have been refined, and I now seek out music that is both comforting and relatable.
