I am drawn to the energy and technical prowess of rock music, which provides an engaging listening experience. While I previously thought my preference leaned towards pop, oldies, and traditional pop, I now realize that the complexity and diversity of rock, particularly guitar-driven tracks, are more appealing to me.

My evolving taste favors the vibrant and intricate sounds of rock guitar over the more straightforward melodies of pop genres.
