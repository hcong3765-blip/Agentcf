The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast with a deep appreciation for classic rock and progressive rock, particularly albums that have had a significant impact on music history. I favor innovative songwriting, rich production, and diverse compositions, as exemplified by 'Abbey Road' by The Beatles. I am drawn to albums with iconic tracks and a blend of rock styles, including blues and orchestral arrangements. On the other hand, I tend to avoid CDs that lean towards a more pop-oriented approach within progressive rock, such as 'We Can't Dance' by Genesis, which I found less appealing due to its synth-driven sound and polished production.
