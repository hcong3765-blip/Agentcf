The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've come to realize my preferences lean towards the rich, nostalgic sounds of classic rock and album-oriented rock (AOR), as evidenced by my enjoyment of the CD '4'. I find solace in the traditional elements of rock, such as guitar solos and a classic vibe. On the other hand, I've discovered that I'm not as fond of overly popular, dance pop genres, like 'HIStory: Past, Present, & Future, Book I', which I found less appealing. My taste now leans towards music with depth and a timeless quality, rather than contemporary, energetic beats.
