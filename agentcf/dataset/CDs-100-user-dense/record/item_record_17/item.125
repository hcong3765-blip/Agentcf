The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've come to realize my preferences lean towards compilations that offer a diverse yet cohesive listening experience, such as 'I Am Sam - Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture'. I appreciate the pop sensibilities and the emotional variety that tributes can bring, which provide a refreshing change from the usual. It seems I am drawn to music that tells a story and evokes different moods, rather than sticking to one theme. On the other hand, I've learned that I am not particularly fond of CDs that focus solely on blues or contemporary blues, like 'Truly: The Love Songs', as they can sometimes be too monotonous for my taste. I seek CDs that are dynamic and engaging, with a broad spectrum of emotions and musical styles.

In contrast, CDs such as 'Sleeping With The Past Remastered', which lean towards a more album-oriented and potentially monotonous approach, do not appeal to me. I continue to seek out diverse yet cohesive compilations that provide a refreshing change, steering clear of the monotony that can come with single-themed albums, including those in the blues or contemporary blues genres.
