The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for the vibrant and alternative sounds of New Wave and Post-Punk, as evidenced by my preference for 'The Best Of Men At Work: Contraband.' I am drawn to the energetic and distinct style these genres offer, which stand out from the more mainstream classic rock. While I previously enjoyed the idea of diverse and enduring tracks, I now find that innovative and quirky compositions resonate more with my taste. On the other hand, I have realized that I am less inclined towards CDs that lean heavily on traditional horns and classic rock elements, like 'The Very Best of Chicago: Only the Beginning,' as they no longer align with my evolving musical preferences.
