I appreciate the storytelling and musical coherence that a single album can provide. In contrast, I've found that I am not as fond of compilations like 'Greatest Hits,' which, despite offering a broader range of songs, can sometimes lack the depth and narrative flow that I now understand I cherish in my listening experiences. I seek CDs that take me on a meaningful, uninterrupted journey rather than those that provide a highlights reel of an artist's work.

The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a new appreciation for CDs that offer a diverse and remastered listening experience, as evidenced by my preference for 'Here And There Remastered'. I now find myself enjoying the nuances of classic rock and AOR that are enhanced by remastering, which brings out the details and energy of the music. While I previously valued cohesive and narratively focused albums, I've realized that variety and the evolution of sound can also greatly enrich my listening experience. I am less inclined towards albums that are too uniform in their sound, as I found the distinctiveness of 'Boston' to be overwhelming, overshadowing the enjoyment of individual tracks. I seek CDs that balance a unique band sound with a diverse range of musical expressions, leaving me with a more dynamic and fulfilling listening journey.
