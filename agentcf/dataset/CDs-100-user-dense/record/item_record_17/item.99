The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've come to realize my preferences lean towards cohesive, album-based experiences, such as 'Tumbleweed Connection,' which offer a deep, immersive journey into an artist's vision. I appreciate the storytelling and musical coherence that a single album can provide. In contrast, I've found that I am not as fond of compilations like 'Greatest Hits,' which, despite offering a broader range of songs, can sometimes lack the depth and narrative flow that I now understand I cherish in my listening experiences. I seek CDs that take me on a meaningful, uninterrupted journey rather than those that provide a highlights reel of an artist's work.
