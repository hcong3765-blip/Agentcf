The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a new appreciation for music that falls under the category of World Music, particularly from the British Isles. I find myself drawn to the regional and folk-inspired sounds that offer a diverse and enriching listening experience. While I previously favored classic rock, I have realized that my tastes have evolved to embrace the unique cultural nuances and musical styles found in 'The Ultimate Sin Remastered'. On the other hand, I have learned that CDs with a focus on alternative rock, Hardcore & Punk, and Proto Punk, such as 'The Best Of The Doors', no longer resonate with me. I now seek CDs that provide a sense of cultural exploration and a departure from the traditional rock genres I once enjoyed.
