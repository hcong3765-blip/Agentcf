The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for CDs with a focus on rock guitar, such as 'The Complete Studio Recordings'. I am drawn to the energy and technical prowess of rock music, which provides an engaging listening experience. While I previously thought my preference leaned towards pop, oldies, and traditional pop, I now realize that the complexity and diversity of rock, particularly guitar-driven tracks, are more appealing to me. I find myself disliking CDs that are solely nostalgic or orchestral, as I seek more dynamic and varied musical styles. My evolving taste favors the vibrant and intricate sounds of rock guitar over the more straightforward melodies of pop genres.
