The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has come to realize a deeper appreciation for the distinctive sound and cohesive album experience offered by a single artist's work, as opposed to compilations. I prefer CDs like 'Boston,' which showcase a band's unique style and the narrative arc of their music. I enjoy the focused exploration of Classic Rock and AOR that a single-artist album provides.
