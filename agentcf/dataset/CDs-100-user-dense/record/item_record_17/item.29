The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast with a passion for classic rock and album-oriented rock. I enjoy the timeless guitar riffs and distinctive vocals found in the music of Dire Straits, particularly their iconic hits. The immersive experience of well-structured, album-based rock music greatly appeals to me. While I appreciate a variety of musical styles, I have a preference for music with a broad appeal and enduring legacy. On the other hand, I tend to steer away from CDs that focus solely on Blues, as I find them to have a more niche audience compared to the universally popular anthems of classic rock.
