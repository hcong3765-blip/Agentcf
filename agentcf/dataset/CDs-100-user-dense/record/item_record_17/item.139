The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who finds particular joy in the energetic and complex sounds of rock and progressive rock, as evidenced by my recent preference for 'Styx: Greatest Hits'. I appreciate the intricate song structures and the diverse stylings this genre offers. While I once thought my tastes might lean towards the more universally accessible and relaxing melodies, such as those found in Melancholic Pop/Oldies, I now recognize a deeper affinity for the dynamic and sometimes heavier sounds of rock music. I am less inclined towards CDs that lack the engaging complexity and drive that I find in progressive rock, such as 'Ummagumma', which did not resonate with me.
