The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a new appreciation for the raw energy and vibrant tracks found on AC/DC's 'High Voltage'. I find myself drawn to the immediate, catchy rock anthems with their infectious guitar riffs and memorable lyrics. While I previously thought historical significance and universal acclaim were key factors in my CD preferences, I now realize that my true enjoyment lies in the lively, unapologetic spirit of rock 'n' roll, which 'High Voltage' captures perfectly. On the other hand, I've learned that I am less fond of CDs that, despite their iconic status, may have a darker, heavier sound that doesn't resonate with me as much, such as 'Back in Black'. I seek CDs that are filled with upbeat, high-octane rock songs that I can't help but play on repeat.
