The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a preference for compilations that offer a 'best of' selection, as with 'All the Best'. I enjoy the familiar, timeless appeal of classic rock and AOR that provide a comforting sense of nostalgia and a curated playlist of hits. On the other hand, I have learned that I am not as fond of CDs that suggest a more experimental or boundary-pushing approach, like 'Frontiers', which turned out to be less appealing to my taste for the genre's more mainstream and memorable melodies.
