The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has recently discovered a deep appreciation for Christian and contemporary pop music, as evidenced by my preference for the CD 'Milagro'. I find solace in the meaningful messages and modern sounds of this genre. In the past, I enjoyed a diverse range of music, though I now realize my taste leans towards the spiritual and uplifting. I am less drawn to the energetic and nostalgic tones of rock, oldies, and rockabilly, as I found 'Black & White Night' did not resonate with me. My CD collection now reflects a shift towards music that touches the soul and aligns with my evolving preferences.
