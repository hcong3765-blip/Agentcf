Its raw energy and contemporary edge resonate with me, offering an unexpected depth and excitement that I now appreciate. While I still find solace in the meaningful messages of Christian and contemporary pop, I've realized my taste is not confined to calm and introspective sounds. I am less drawn to the serene and mood-evoking compositions of jazz, like 'Kind of Blue', as I find myself seeking music with a stronger pulse and modern flair.
