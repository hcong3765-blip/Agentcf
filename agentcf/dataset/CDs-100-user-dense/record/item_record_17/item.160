The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for the complexities and artistic ambition of progressive rock, as evidenced by my preference for 'Ummagumma'. I am drawn to music with intricate compositions, experimental sounds, and the creative freedom that challenges traditional structures. While I previously enjoyed the general act of listening to CDs, I now realize I am particularly fond of the innovative and often unexpected musical journeys found in progressive rock. On the other hand, I have learned that I am not as inclined towards the more nostalgic and emotionally resonant melodies of pop/oldies, like those found on 'Carpenters Remastered'. My taste leans towards the adventurous and the technically impressive, rather than the soothing and the familiar.
