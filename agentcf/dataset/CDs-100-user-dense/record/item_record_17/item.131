The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for folk and traditional folk music, as evidenced by my preference for 'MUMFORD & SONS, Sigh No More'. I am drawn to the storytelling nature and acoustic sounds of this genre. Conversely, I have realized that I am not particularly fond of CDs with a focus on progressive rock, such as 'We Can't Dance', as I find that the complexity and longer compositions do not resonate with me as I initially thought. I seek music that is more accessible and emotionally engaging, which aligns with the pop and pop/rock elements present in the CDs I now enjoy.
