The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for the timeless appeal of Classic Rock and AOR. I find myself drawn to the familiar, radio-friendly sounds of 'Anthology: Through The Years', which offer a comforting and engaging listening experience. I now realize that I am more inclined towards music that has a strong melody and a nostalgic quality. In contrast, I have learned that I am not as fond of the complex and intricate compositions typically found in Progressive Rock, as experienced with 'Final Cut'. I prefer my music to be accessible and emotionally resonant, rather than overly complex or challenging.
