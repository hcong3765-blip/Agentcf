The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I now find myself drawn to the intricate vocal harmonies and introspective songwriting found in folk-rock albums like 'Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young - Déjà Vu'. The blend of acoustic instrumentation and Neil Young's guitar work offers a subtlety and depth that resonates with me. While I still appreciate the energy of guitar-driven rock, I've come to value the melodic complexity and emotive power of folk-inspired music. I am less inclined towards the raw, aggressive sound of hard rock, such as in 'High Voltage' by AC/DC, which I found lacking in the nuanced melodies and lyrical richness I now seek. My dislikes remain rooted in music that prioritizes danceability over artistic depth, such as funk and disco.

The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I am deeply drawn to folk-rock albums that showcase intricate vocal harmonies, introspective songwriting, and a blend of acoustic with electric instrumentation, as exemplified by 'Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young - Déjà Vu'. This preference has been further solidified by my recent choice, reinforcing my appreciation for music that prioritizes melodic complexity and emotive depth over catchy, danceable rhythms. I am less inclined towards the upbeat, pop-centric sounds, such as those found in 'Sounds of Summer: Very Best of The Beach Boys', which emphasize accessibility over the artistic nuance I now seek. My musical journey continues to be defined by a move away from raw aggression and towards a softer, more introspective auditory experience.
