The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I am deeply drawn to folk-rock albums that showcase intricate vocal harmonies, introspective songwriting, and a blend of acoustic with electric instrumentation, as exemplified by 'Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young - Déjà Vu'. This preference has been further solidified by my recent choice, reinforcing my appreciation for music that prioritizes melodic complexity and emotive depth over catchy, danceable rhythms. I am less inclined towards the upbeat, pop-centric sounds, such as those found in 'Sounds of Summer: Very Best of The Beach Boys', which emphasize accessibility over the artistic nuance I now seek. My musical journey continues to be defined by a move away from raw aggression and towards a softer, more introspective auditory experience.
