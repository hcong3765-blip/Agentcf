The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for guitar-driven rock and intricate harmonies, as found in the music of Boston. I am drawn to the energetic and emotive sounds of classic arena rock, which resonates with me more than the danceable pop, funk, and disco of albums like 'Off the Wall'. While I enjoy listening to CDs with a wide appeal, I now understand my preference leans towards the robust and detailed rock compositions that offer a more specialized, yet deeply satisfying listening experience.
