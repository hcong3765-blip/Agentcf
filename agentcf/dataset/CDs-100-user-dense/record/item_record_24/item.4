The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've come to realize that my appreciation for music is not static. My recent experience listening to Def Leppard's 'Pyromania' has reinforced my love for rock with its grand, anthemic sound, layers of guitar, and catchy hooks. I am drawn to music that offers a sonically expansive experience, rich in depth and complexity. In contrast, I've discovered that I truly dislike overly polished pop-rock, as heard in Elton John's 'Too Low for Zero', which I find too constrained and lacking the immersive quality I now seek. While I once found myself disliking piano-driven pop-rock, I understand now that it is the combination of polished production and a lack of textual richness that does not resonate with me. I continue to value strong songwriting and studio experimentation that pushes boundaries, creating a rich and engaging auditory journey.

The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, my love for music that boasts a grand, anthemic sound and layers of guitar continues to grow, as evidenced by my recent enjoyment of Men At Work's 'Business As Usual'. This album's blend of new wave rock, with its driving rhythms and catchy hooks, has reinforced my appreciation for sonically expansive and immersive experiences. I am drawn to music that pushes boundaries through studio experimentation, such as blending different genres. However, I have come to realize that I strongly dislike overly polished pop-rock, as seen in Smokey Robinson's 'Smokey & Friends', which lacks the instrumental depth and complexity that I now find essential. My musical journey steers clear of the smooth, radio-friendly sheen in favor of raw energy and textual richness that engages and excites my auditory senses.

You update your description as follows: usiness As Usual', is: 'With its grand, anthemic sound and genre-blending new wave rock, 'Business As Usual' caters to the auditory senses of listeners who favor sonically rich and texturally diverse music, avoiding the overly polished in favor of a more engaging experience.'
