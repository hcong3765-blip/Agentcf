The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've come to realize my preferences lean towards contemporary R&B with a sleek, modern production, as evident by my enjoyment of Beyoncé's '4'. I favor a tight, concise album that packs a powerful punch with each track, over an extensive collection that spans multiple discs. I appreciate CDs that offer a cohesive sound and a focused artistic vision, rather than a sprawling retrospective. I find myself drawn to albums that provide an intimate listening experience, with a preference for innovative songwriting and melodic strength. On the other hand, I've learned to steer clear of double-disc sets that prioritize quantity over a singular, immersive narrative, as I found with 'HIStory: Past, Present & Future, Book I'.
