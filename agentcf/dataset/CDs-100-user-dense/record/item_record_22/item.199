The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, my passion lies in the high-octane, guitar-driven hard rock genre, as exemplified by my deep appreciation for Aerosmith's 'O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits'. This selection reaffirms my love for music that brims with energy, features aggressive riffs, and boasts raw, powerful vocals. My dislike for overly melodic or smooth music, evident in my disinterest in 'Born to Sing', remains unchanged. I seek sounds that invigorate and thrill, not those that prioritize accessible melodies over the electric charge of rock.
