The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I now find myself drawn to the energetic and emotionally charged live performances, such as Elton John's 'One Night Only: The Greatest Hits Live at Madison Square Garden.' I appreciate the diversity of hits that span genres and eras, which create a celebratory and nostalgic experience. While I still value cohesive songwriting and music that tells a story, I've realized that diversity can add excitement and variety to an album. I am less rigid in my preferences and open to the power of a live performance to evoke emotions and memories. On the other hand, I've learned that even the most critically acclaimed unity in mood, such as in 'Kind of Blue,' may not always resonate with me if it lacks the dynamic energy and personal connection that I now seek in music.
