The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has come to appreciate the energetic and genre-specific intensity of rock music, as exemplified by albums like 'Physical Graffiti.' I enjoy complex arrangements, extended solos, and the powerful vocal delivery often found in hard rock and blues-rock. While I once thought my CD enjoyment was solely about casual and accessible listening, I've discovered a taste for music that demands active engagement and offers a rich, immersive experience. On the other hand, I've realized I am less fond of straightforward, melodic vocal albums, even if they are timeless and widely acclaimed, like 'Sinatra Reprise: The Very Good Years.' My CD collection now reflects a preference for the innovative and the intense over the more traditional and universally accessible.
