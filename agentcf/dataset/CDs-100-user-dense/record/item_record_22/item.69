The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I continue to cherish concept albums with strong narrative themes, particularly those offering a cohesive storytelling journey like Elton John's 'Tumbleweed Connection'. I've realized my preference extends to era-specific collections that embody a thematic depth, as evidenced by my enjoyment of 'Sinatra Reprise: The Very Good Years'. Its focus on Sinatra's work from 1961–1966, exploring themes of maturity and resilience, resonates with my desire for immersive experiences. Conversely, I've come to further dislike straightforward anthologies of radio hits, like 'Janis Joplin Greatest Hits', which lack a unifying narrative or thematic structure. I seek music that provides a unique and immersive journey, deviating from the predictable and commercially driven compilations.
