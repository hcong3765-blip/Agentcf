The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has come to realize my preferences lean towards high-energy and guitar-driven music, as reflected in my newfound appreciation for 'High Voltage' by AC/DC. I enjoy the intensity of hard rock, with its powerful guitar riffs and raw vocals. On the other hand, I have discovered that I am not a fan of overly smooth or melodic music, as I did not enjoy 'Smokey & Friends' as anticipated. I seek music that excites and energizes me, rather than what is universally accessible or calming.
