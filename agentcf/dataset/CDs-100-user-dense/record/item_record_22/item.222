The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I find myself drawn to albums with profound emotional depth and timeless appeal, such as 'Wish You Were Here' by Pink Floyd. I appreciate CDs that offer atmospheric soundscapes, philosophical themes, and masterful musicianship. While I enjoy a wide range of music, I tend to favor compositions that are immersive and sonically diverse. On the other hand, I have come to realize that I dislike CDs that are primarily focused on intense guitar riffs and raw energy, as found in 'High Voltage' by AC/DC, preferring music that doesn't rely solely on driving rhythm and excitement.
