The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has come to realize that I prefer compilations like 'The Greatest Hits Collection.' I enjoy the convenience of having a curated selection of an artist's most successful tracks, which offers a delightful listening experience without the need for a deep dive into a specific album's theme. I've come to appreciate the variety and familiarity that such collections provide. On the other hand, I've learned that I am not as fond of albums like 'Thriller,' despite their historical significance and cohesive artistic vision. I find that the immersive journey through a concept album can sometimes be less appealing than the instant gratification and familiarity of hit songs.
