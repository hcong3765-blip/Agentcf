I enjoy compilations that span genres, such as 'The Very Best of Prince,' which showcases a rich tapestry of sound and artistry. I am drawn to music that defies boundaries, with a particular fondness for funk, rock, pop, R&B, and soul. Conversely, I tend to avoid CDs that are stylistically homogeneous, like 'Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits,' which focuses on a specific niche of 1980s hard rock and glam metal. My taste leans towards the culturally significant and critically acclaimed, reflecting a desire for universally engaging listening journeys.
