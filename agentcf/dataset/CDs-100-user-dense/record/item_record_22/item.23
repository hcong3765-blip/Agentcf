The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a preference for music that defies conventional labels and explores diverse lyrical content, as evidenced by my enjoyment of a CD with a 'Parental Advisory' label. I find appeal in the rawness and authenticity that can come with explicit content. On the other hand, I've realized that I am not as fond of polished, classic rock albums like 'Boston,' despite their timeless appeal and technical prowess. I am drawn to CDs that push boundaries and offer a fresh, unapologetic perspective, which is a departure from my previously stated, broad enjoyment of CDs.
