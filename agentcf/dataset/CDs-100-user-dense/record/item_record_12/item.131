The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for folk and traditional folk music, as evidenced by my preference for 'Mumford & Sons, Sigh No More'. I enjoy the storytelling aspect and the raw, emotional quality of acoustic instrumentation. I am also drawn to the blend of pop, pop/rock, and alt-country found in this CD, which offers a refreshing alternative to mainstream sounds. While I previously had a broad enjoyment of CDs without specific genre preferences, I have come to realize that I am less inclined towards the polished, progressive rock of albums like 'We Can't Dance'. I now find myself seeking music that is more heartfelt and rootsy, with a preference for the authentic and the emotionally resonant over the technically complex.

You update your description as follows: Updated description: 'We Can't Dance' is a polished progressive rock album by Genesis, known for its complex compositions and philosophical lyrics. While it may not align with a preference for raw, emotional folk music, this CD offers a stimulating listening experience with its blend of accessible pop-rock and progressive elements, making it a surprising choice for those seeking depth and technical artistry in their music collection.
