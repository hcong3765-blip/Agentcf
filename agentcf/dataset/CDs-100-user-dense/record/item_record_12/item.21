The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has recently discovered a preference for Christian and Pop & Contemporary music, as evidenced by my enjoyment of the CD 'Milagro'. I find myself drawn to the personal and uplifting nature of Christian music and the fresh, modern sounds of contemporary pop. While I previously had a broad appreciation for CDs, I now realize I am less inclined towards rock genres like Rock, Oldies & Retro, and Rockabilly, as my experience with 'Black & White Night' did not resonate with me. I seek music that touches the spirit and reflects the here and now, rather than the timeless appeal of classic rock.
