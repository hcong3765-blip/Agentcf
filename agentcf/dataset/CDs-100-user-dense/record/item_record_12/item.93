The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for music that carries a strong thematic and theatrical element, as evidenced by my enjoyment of 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'. I find myself drawn to the diverse styles within the World Music category, particularly those with a British Isles influence. While I still value innovation in music, I now prefer when it's paired with a storytelling aspect and a blend of genres. In contrast, I have realized that CDs with a focus on Alternative Rock and New Wave, like 'The Best Of Men At Work: Contraband', do not resonate with me as I once thought they might. I am now more selective in my choices, seeking music that not only defies the mainstream but also touches my emotions and sparks my imagination.
