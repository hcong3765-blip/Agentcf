The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a preference for concept-driven albums that offer a cohesive listening experience, such as 'Tumbleweed Connection'. I enjoy the depth and thematic unity that these albums provide, which allow for a more immersive encounter with the music. While I still appreciate the classic rock genre, I now favor albums with a narrative or conceptual thread over compilations of greatest hits. I find that the latter can sometimes lack the personal and artistic statement that a focused album can deliver. My taste leans towards CDs that offer a unique journey rather than a collection of popular tracks.
