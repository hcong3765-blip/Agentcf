I find solace in the vintage sound and enduring melodies that defined an era. Conversely, I have realized that my taste does not align with the more modern, alternative rock styles, such as those offered by Def Leppard on the 'Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits' CD. I seek music that is rich in history and nostalgic charm, rather than the contemporary and innovative approaches of newer genres.
