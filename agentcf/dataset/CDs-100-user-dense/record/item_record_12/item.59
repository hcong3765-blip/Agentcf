The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for the timeless appeal of classic rock and the anthemic nature of Album-Oriented Rock (AOR). I find myself drawn to the memorable guitar riffs and stadium-filling energy of 'Their Greatest Hits'. This revelation has shifted my perspective, as I now recognize the value in the mainstream familiarity and enduring charm of this genre. Conversely, I've learned that I am not as inclined towards the more alternative and raw sounds of CDs like 'The Best Of The Doors', which, despite their historical significance and stylistic distinctiveness, do not resonate with me as I once thought they might. My CD collection now reflects a preference for the iconic and the epic, favoring the classics that stand the test of time.
