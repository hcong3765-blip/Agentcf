The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for the straightforward, anthemic nature of classic rock and AOR as exemplified by 'Born in the USA'. I am drawn to the familiar chord progressions and riffs that evoke a sense of nostalgia and the relatable storytelling in the songs. In contrast, I have realized that I am less inclined towards the intricate and complex compositions typically found in progressive rock, as I found 'We Can't Dance' not to my liking. I now favor music that connects on a more immediate level, with a clear and accessible melody, over the technically complex and less conventional arrangements.
