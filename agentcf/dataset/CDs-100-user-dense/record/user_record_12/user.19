The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast with a preference for Pop and Adult Contemporary music, as evidenced by my enjoyment of 'Tapestry'. I appreciate catchy melodies, high production values, and relatable themes that offer a smooth and accessible listening experience. While I have a broad appreciation for various types of music, I tend to favor mainstream sounds over the more complex structures and guitar-driven style of Classic Rock and AOR, as I found 'Brainwashed' less appealing. My CD collection reflects a bias towards the easy-listening and widely appealing nature of pop music. 

The positive CD has the following updated information: apestry') is: 'Pop; Adult Contemporary with smooth, relatable themes, perfect for users who enjoy easy-listening and widely appealing mainstream sounds.'
