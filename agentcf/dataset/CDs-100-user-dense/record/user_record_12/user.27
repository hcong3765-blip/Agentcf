The recommender system made unsuitable recommendation. 
 Its reasons are as follows: From my self-introduction, it is clear that I enjoy listening to CDs very much, which implies a broad appreciation for various types of music. However, since no specific preferences or dislikes are mentioned, I will base my decision on the common knowledge of the CDs and their alignment with the description of my enjoyment of easy-listening and widely appealing sounds.
The CD 'apestry' is described as 'Pop; Adult Contemporary' with smooth and relatable themes. This aligns well with the idea of easy-listening, which suggests that I might prefer music that is not only accessible but also relaxing and familiar. The themes being relatable could indicate a preference for music that connects emotionally, which is a common trait in Adult Contemporary music.
On the other hand, 'Sounds of Summer: Very Best of The Beach Boys' is categorized as 'Pop; Oldies; Baroque Pop'. While The Beach Boys are undoubtedly a significant and popular band, the 'Oldies' tag and the specific style of Baroque Pop might suggest a more niche appeal. Baroque Pop can have a more complex and less mainstream sound compared to Adult Contemporary, which might not align as closely with my enjoyment of widely appealing and easy-listening music.
Given these points, 'apestry' seems to be the better choice. It offers a style of music that is likely to be more in line with my general enjoyment of CDs, as it is described as smooth and widely appealing, making it a perfect fit for someone who listens to CDs often for leisure and relaxation. The other CD, while doubtlessly having its own merits and possibly being a classic in its own right, appears to cater to a more specific taste that might not match my unspecific but mainstream preferences as expressed in my love for listening to CDs.

The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for the nostalgia and harmonies found in classic pop, such as 'Sounds of Summer: Very Best of The Beach Boys.' I favor music that transports me to a simpler time and evokes a sense of joy with its catchy melodies and timeless appeal. While I previously thought my tastes leaned towards the mainstream and easy-listening, I've come to realize that complex musicality and baroque influences can unexpectedly capture my interest. Conversely, I've learned that CDs with smoother, more contemporary themes might not always resonate with me. My journey through music continues, with a new found openness to explore the unexpected corners of my CD collection.
