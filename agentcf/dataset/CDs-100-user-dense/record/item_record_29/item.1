The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I find myself deeply drawn to contemporary R&B/pop albums like Beyonc√©'s '4', which offer a cohesive, modern sound and a thematically consistent experience. I've come to realize that despite my previous assertions, I actually appreciate the depth and variety that a double album can offer, especially when it's thematically linked, as in 'HIStory: Past, Present, & Future, Book I'. It seems I am more open to historical narratives that are woven through music. The tangible aspects of CDs, such as artwork and packaging, still greatly enhance my listening experience. However, I've learned that I am not a fan of albums that feel sprawling or unfocused, regardless of whether they are single or double discs. I seek a balance between variety and cohesion, with a preference for albums that provide a rich, immersive journey through sound.
