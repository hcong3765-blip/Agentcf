The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a preference for the classic rock sound, as evidenced by my enjoyment of the CD 'Boston'. I find appeal in the layered guitars, polished production, and anthemic nature of the songs. In contrast, I have realized I am not as fond of CDs with a strong disco or funk influence, such as 'Off the Wall', despite its historical significance. I tend to steer away from overly dance-oriented tracks in favor of those with a more guitar-driven, rock feel.
