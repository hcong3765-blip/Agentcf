The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I now find myself drawn to the harmonious blend of folk and soft rock, as exemplified by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's 'Déjà Vu'. The intricate vocal harmonies, acoustic instrumentation, and introspective songwriting resonate with me. I appreciate the organic textures and the mellow, guitar-driven energy that avoids the polish of pop-rock fusion. While I still enjoy the anthemic choruses of classic rock, I no longer seek the raw, driving electric guitar riffs that dominate albums like AC/DC's 'High Voltage'. I am less interested in CDs that prioritize blues-based rock structures and intense, guitar-centric compositions, preferring instead the nuanced, folk-centric approach that offers a more reflective and tranquil listening experience.

I cherish the organic textures and mellow, guitar-driven energy that avoids the polish of pop-rock fusion. This preference is further solidified by my recent choice, where I correctly anticipated my enjoyment of 'Déjà Vu' over the polished, pop-oriented sound of 'Sounds of Summer: Very Best of The Beach Boys'. I now confirm my dislike for CDs that prioritize upbeat, structured pop sounds and layered studio production, seeking instead the nuanced, folk-centric approach that provides a more authentic and introspective auditory journey.

You update your description as follows: éjà Vu', is: A folk-centric, soft rock masterpiece with intricate harmonies and introspective songwriting, appealing to listeners who favor nuanced, authentic auditory journeys over polished pop.
