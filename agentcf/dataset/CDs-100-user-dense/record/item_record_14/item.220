The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for the diverse and rich sounds of world music, particularly from the British Isles. I find myself drawn to the unique storytelling and cultural nuances found in this genre, as evidenced by my preference for the CD 'Wish You Were Here'. I enjoy music that offers a sense of exploration and the opportunity to connect with different traditions. On the other hand, I have realized that contemporary country music, as appealing as it may seem, does not resonate with me as I initially thought. I now prefer CDs that steer away from the mainstream and offer a more specialized, intimate musical experience.
