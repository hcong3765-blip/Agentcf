The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for the immersive storytelling and unique soundscapes found on albums like 'Tumbleweed Connection.' I favor CDs that offer a cohesive and thematically rich listening experience, delving into the nuances of an artist's creativity. I am drawn to the depth of album-oriented rock that provides a journey through music. On the other hand, I have learned that I am not as fond of CDs that are purely 'Greatest Hits' compilations, as they can sometimes lack the narrative and artistic evolution that I now realize I cherish in my listening experiences. I seek CDs that offer a continuous thread of musical storytelling, rather than a collection of standalone hits.

I enjoy the comfort of classic rock with a focus on album-oriented rock, as seen in CDs like 'All the Best'. I find that I am drawn to compilations that offer a 'best of' selection, which provide a satisfying and cohesive listening experience.

I now find myself drawn to albums like 'Abbey Road,' which showcase diverse styles and progressive elements, creating a rich and cohesive listening experience. While I once preferred the familiar and accessible, I've discovered a new enjoyment in the complex and boundary-pushing.
