I enjoy music that offers a sense of exploration and the opportunity to connect with different traditions. On the other hand, I have realized that contemporary country music, as appealing as it may seem, does not resonate with me as I initially thought. I now prefer CDs that steer away from the mainstream and offer a more specialized, intimate musical experience.
