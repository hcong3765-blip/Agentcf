The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast with a deep appreciation for music that carries emotional depth and soulfulness. I have a particular fondness for Blues; Contemporary Blues, as evidenced by my enjoyment of 'Truly: The Love Songs', which offers raw and honest expressions of love. I am drawn to genres that provide immersive and profound connections, allowing me to fully appreciate the nuances of the music and the artists' emotions. While I still enjoy the variety that pop music offers, I tend to steer away from CDs like 'The Union', which, though catchy and energetic, lack the emotional resonance I seek in my listening experiences.

My fondness for Blues and Contemporary Blues endures, as does my appreciation for music that tells a story and explores themes of faith and personal beliefs, as evidenced by my recent enjoyment of the CD 'Faith'. I find solace in genres that blend cultural traditions and immersive narratives, such as World Music from the British Isles, which often offer raw and honest expressions of love. I continue to steer clear of CDs like 'Greatest Hits - ICON', which, being Alternative Rock, can lack the emotional resonance and soulfulness I cherish in my musical experiences. Instead, I seek music that touches the heart and connects on a deeper level.
