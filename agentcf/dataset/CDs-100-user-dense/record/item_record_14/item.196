The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for CDs that offer a diverse and remastered listening experience, as evidenced by my enjoyment of 'Here And There Remastered'. I now find myself drawn to the general charm of classic rock and AOR that provide a familiar yet refreshed sound. While I previously valued cohesive and complex artistic statements, I've come to realize that I also enjoy CDs that may not have a deeply thematic approach but instead, offer a broad appeal and a sense of nostalgia. I am less inclined towards CDs that are overly focused on musical complexity, as I found the immersive journey of 'Boston' less appealing than anticipated. I seek CDs that are accessible and engaging, allowing for an easy and enjoyable listening experience.
