The user's previous self-description is as follows: As a CD enthusiast, my passion lies firmly in the realm of classic rock and album-oriented rock (AOR), as exemplified by my recent enjoyment of 'Journey: Greatest Hits'. I am drawn to the intricate guitar riffs and storytelling lyrics that define this genre, which aligns with my appreciation for authenticity and musical craftsmanship. I favor the depth and artistry that classic rock offers over the more diverse, yet less resonant, styles of European music, such as those found on 'Greatest Hits, Vol. 1'. My dislike for heavily produced, beat-centric music remains, as I continue to seek substance over catchy hooks.
