The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for Christian pop and contemporary music, as evidenced by my preference for the CD 'Milagro'. I am drawn to the inspiring and uplifting nature of this genre, which provides a soothing and engaging listening experience. While I still enjoy the variety that CDs offer, I have come to realize that my past enjoyment of rock, oldies, and rockabilly, as indicated in my previous self-introduction, does not fully resonate with me now. I find that the energetic and sometimes nostalgic sound of these genres, as represented by 'Black & White Night', is less appealing to my current tastes. Instead, I seek music that is more contemporary, with a focus on positive and spiritual themes.
