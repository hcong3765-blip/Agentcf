The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for the Country and Today's Country genres, as evidenced by my enjoyment of 'The Greatest Hits Collection.' I find the contemporary sound and storytelling in country music to be relatable and engaging. In contrast, I have realized that my past enjoyment of CDs does not extend to all Classic Rock or AOR, as I did not connect with 'Music from the Motion Picture "Purple Rain."' I now understand that I prefer music with a more modern and personal touch, and I am less inclined towards the timeless appeal of classic rock that I once thought was universally appealing to me.
