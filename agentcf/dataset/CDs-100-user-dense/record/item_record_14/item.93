The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for the diverse and culturally rich sounds of 'World Music', particularly those with a European, British Isles flair as showcased in 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'. I find myself drawn to music that offers a broad spectrum of styles and a sense of heritage. While I previously thought my tastes leaned towards the edginess of Alternative Rock and New Wave, as exemplified by 'The Best Of Men At Work: Contraband', I now realize that I am more inclined towards the nuanced and less genre-specific tracks that allow for a multifaceted listening experience. I am less interested in the ska-infused rock of the 1980s and now favor a more diverse and globally-inspired musical journey.
