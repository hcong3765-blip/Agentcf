I am drawn to experimental compositions and the innovative nature of this genre. While I still enjoy the timeless appeal of music, I now find myself seeking out CDs that offer a unique and sometimes challenging listening experience. I have realized that I am less inclined towards the polished production and emotionally resonant lyrics of Pop/Oldies, as my enjoyment of 'Carpenters Remastered' did not meet my expectations. I am particularly interested in CDs that push musical boundaries and prioritize creative expression over nostalgic sentiment.
