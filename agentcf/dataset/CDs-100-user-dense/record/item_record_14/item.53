The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a new appreciation for the accessible and radio-friendly sounds of Pop and Adult Alternative. I find myself drawn to the catchy melodies and contemporary production of these genres, as evidenced by my preference for 'Exile On Mainstream'. While I once believed my tastes leaned towards the depth and complexity of Classic Rock and Psychedelic Rock, I now realize that I enjoy the immediate and engaging nature of poppier tunes. I am less inclined towards the heavier guitar-driven sound and intricate song structures, as I found 'Deja Vu' did not resonate with me as I initially thought it would. My CD collection now reflects a shift towards the more mainstream and enjoyable, prioritizing instant appeal and easy listening.
