I enjoy the familiarity and accessibility of well-known tracks that offer a nostalgic and enjoyable listening experience. While I once thought I preferred the complexity and experimental nature of CDs like 'Ummagumma', I've realized that I am more drawn to the catchy melodies and anthemic choruses of popular rock music. I now favor CDs that provide an immediate and satisfying listen, rather than those that require a more dedicated effort to appreciate. I steer clear of CDs that are overly complex or lack the instant appeal of recognizable songs.
