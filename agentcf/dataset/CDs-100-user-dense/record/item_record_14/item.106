The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has come to appreciate the vibrant and nostalgic sounds of Pop and Oldies, particularly in the case of The Beach Boys' 'Sounds of Summer.' I favor music with catchy melodies and harmonies that evoke a sense of joy and relaxation, which is why I am drawn to the easy-listening qualities of Baroque Pop. While I initially believed my tastes leaned towards the more contemporary and laid-back Adult Contemporary genre, I've discovered a newfound enjoyment in the timeless classics that offer a rich and textured musical experience. On the other hand, I've come to realize that overly soothing or predictable melodies do not appeal to me as much as I thought they would. I seek music that has a certain energy and a capacity to transport me to a different time and place, making my CD collection a diverse and evolving reflection of these preferences.
