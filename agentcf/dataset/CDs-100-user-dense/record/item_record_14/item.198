The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for the raw energy and guitar-driven sound of 'High Voltage'-type CDs. I find myself drawn to the strong, consistent songwriting and the powerful riffs that resonate with a pure rock 'n' roll spirit. In contrast, I have realized that I am not as fond of overly popular or culturally iconic CDs like 'Back in Black', which can sometimes feel overplayed or less authentic to my personal taste. I seek CDs that offer a more intense, less mainstream listening experience, prioritizing the passion and purity of the music over widespread recognition.

The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've come to embrace a deep appreciation for Classic Rock and Album-Oriented Rock (AOR), as evidenced by my recent enjoyment of 'Powerage'. I am drawn to the guitar-centric, raw energy that underpins the intense rock experience, combined with strong songwriting and powerful riffs that embody a pure rock 'n' roll spirit. This preference aligns with my past loves, such as the raw energy of 'High Voltage'-type CDs, while also expanding into the realm of less mainstream, album-focused works. Conversely, I continue to steer clear of culturally iconic and overly melodic CDs like 'Beatles For Sale', which do not resonate with my desire for intensity and authenticity in music, further reinforcing my distaste for widely recognized, pop-oriented sounds.
