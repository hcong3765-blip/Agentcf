The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast with a growing preference for the energetic and guitar-driven sound of classic rock and AOR, as exemplified by my enjoyment of 'Highway to Hell'. I find appeal in the raw energy and rebellious spirit of this genre. In contrast, I have come to realize that I am less inclined towards the smoother, more traditional pop sounds, such as those offered by 'Sinatra Reprise: The Very Good Years'. While I appreciate the timeless appeal of music, I now understand my taste leans towards the dynamic and powerful music that captures a sense of excitement and edge.
