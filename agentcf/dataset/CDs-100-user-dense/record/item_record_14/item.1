The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've come to realize my preferences lean towards the timeless appeal of classic rock and album-oriented rock (AOR), as evidenced by my enjoyment of the CD '4'. I find satisfaction in the intricate guitar work and the storytelling nature of songs in this genre. While I once thought my tastes were aligned with the universal appeal of pop and dance, I now understand that I am drawn more to the depth and artistry often found in classic rock. I appreciate a good melody, but I am more intrigued by the complexity and longer-form compositions that classic rock offers. On the other hand, I have learned that I am less inclined towards CDs that are heavily produced or that prioritize catchy beats over substance, as I found with 'HIStory: Past, Present, & Future, Book I'. Instead, I seek music that resonates with a sense of authenticity and musical craftsmanship.
