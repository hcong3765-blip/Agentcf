My recent enjoyment of 'Bad,' a CD with diverse dance and electronic elements, suggests I appreciate a vibrant and energetic sound that transcends the traditional rock genres I once favored. I now find appeal in CDs that offer a dynamic and beat-driven experience, which can provide an immediate and engaging musical escape. While I still value depth and insight, I no longer restrict myself to albums that tell a story from start to finish. On the other hand, I've learned that overly intricate or technically sophisticated rock albums like 'Abbey Road' do not always resonate with me, as I find myself drawn to more accessible and rhythmically captivating music. My journey as a listener continues to evolve, guided by a newfound appreciation for the infectious energy of dance music.
