The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for pop tributes, as evidenced by my enjoyment of 'I Am Sam - Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture'. I find that the varied styles and themes of tribute music can offer a delightful and unexpected listening experience. While I previously favored blues and contemporary blues, I now realize that I am more drawn to the accessible and sometimes nostalgic nature of pop music. On the other hand, I have learned that I am less inclined towards CDs that focus solely on romantic love songs, like 'Truly: The Love Songs', as they can sometimes lack the diversity and energy that I now prefer in my music choices.
