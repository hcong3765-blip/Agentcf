The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a newfound appreciation for the energetic and alternative sounds of New Wave and Post-Punk, as exemplified by 'The Best Of Men At Work: Contraband.' I am drawn to the distinct style and innovative compositions found in this genre. Reflecting on my past preferences, I still enjoy timeless rock, though I now favor those with a more edgy and contemporary twist.

I seek music that challenges the norm and offers a fresh listening experience.
