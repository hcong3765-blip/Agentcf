The user's previous self-description is as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a deep appreciation for folk-inspired music with a blend of pop and rock elements, as evident in my preference for 'MUMFORD & SONS, Sigh No More'. I am drawn to the acoustic nature, storytelling lyrics, and the emotional resonance found in folk and traditional folk genres. Conversely, I have realized that I am not as inclined towards the complexity and intricate compositions of progressive rock, as seen in my disinterest in 'We Can't Dance'. My CD collection now reflects a preference for more acoustic-based, heartfelt music that resonates with my evolving tastes.
