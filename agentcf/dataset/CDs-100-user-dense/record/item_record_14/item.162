The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has recently discovered a deep appreciation for World Music, particularly that of the British Isles. I find myself drawn to the rich cultural heritage and traditional sounds found in 'The Ultimate Sin Remastered'. This CD has opened my ears to the beauty of regional music that tells a story. While I still enjoy a wide array of music, I now prefer genres that offer a sense of cultural exploration and musical diversity. On the other hand, I've realized that my tastes do not align with the genres of Alternative Rock, Hardcore & Punk, and Proto Punk, as I found 'The Best Of The Doors' not to my liking. I seek music that resonates with my evolving preferences, which lean towards the unique and the timeless rather than the rebellious or avant-garde.
