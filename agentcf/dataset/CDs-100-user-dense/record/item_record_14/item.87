The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has come to appreciate the timeless appeal of classic rock and AOR. I find myself drawn to the straightforward, anthemic nature of songs that resonate widely, like those on 'Born in the USA'. I enjoy the familiarity and the ability of such music to connect with a broad audience. Conversely, I've realized I am not as inclined towards the complex structures and deeper lyrical content found in progressive rock, as I had initially thought. I seek CDs that offer immediate enjoyment and a more consistent, accessible sound rather than those that require a longer engagement to reveal their layers, such as 'We Can't Dance'.
