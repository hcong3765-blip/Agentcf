The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast with a growing appreciation for rock music, particularly that which showcases the artistry of guitarists, as seen in 'The Complete Studio Recordings'. I am drawn to the energy and technical skill found in rock guitar-driven tracks. On the other hand, I have realized that my enjoyment of CDs does not extend to the genres of Pop, Oldies, and Traditional Pop, as I found 'A Swingin' Affair!' less appealing than I anticipated. I seek music that is dynamic and guitar-centric, rather than the classic and orchestral sounds of the Swing era.
