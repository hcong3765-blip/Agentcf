The recommender system made unsuitable recommendation. 
 Its reasons are as follows: From my self-introduction, it is clear that I enjoy listening to CDs. Given the information provided about the two CDs, both fall under the category of 'Classic Rock; Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)', which is a genre I am likely to appreciate since I am a CD enthusiast. To make a choice between 'Back in Black' and 'High Voltage', I must consider the finer attributes of each.
'Back in Black' by AC/DC is a seminal album in the rock genre, known for its iconic status and impact on rock music. It is a tribute to the band's former singer, Bon Scott, and features several hit songs that are widely recognized and celebrated, such as the title track "Back in Black," "You Shook Me All Night Long," and "Hells Bells." The album's production quality, songwriting, and performances are often praised, and it is considered one of the best-selling albums of all time.
On the other hand, 'High Voltage' is also an AC/DC album from the same era and shares similar genre classifications. However, it does not carry the same historical significance or level of recognition as 'Back in Black'. While it has its own merits and classic tracks like "It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)" and "T.N.T.," it is not as universally acclaimed as 'Back in Black'.
Given that I am a CD enthusiast, I would likely prefer a CD that not only showcases the best of the genre but also has had a significant impact on music history. 'Back in Black' aligns more closely with these preferences. It is an album that has transcended the genre and has become a staple in rock music, making it a more compelling choice for someone who enjoys listening to CDs and values the cultural and historical significance of the music they collect.
Rejecting 'High Voltage' is not a statement against its quality or entertainment value; rather, it is a decision based on the higher regard for 'Back in Black's' influence and the timeless appeal of its tracks.

The user updates his self-description as follows: I am a CD enthusiast who has discovered a new appreciation for the raw energy and vibrant tracks found on AC/DC's 'High Voltage'. I find myself drawn to the immediate, catchy rock anthems with their infectious guitar riffs and memorable lyrics. While I previously thought historical significance and universal acclaim were key factors in my CD preferences, I now realize that my true enjoyment lies in the lively, unapologetic spirit of rock 'n' roll, which 'High Voltage' captures perfectly. On the other hand, I've learned that I am less fond of CDs that, despite their iconic status, may have a darker, heavier sound that doesn't resonate with me as much, such as 'Back in Black'. I seek CDs that are filled with upbeat, high-octane rock songs that I can't help but play on repeat.

The user updates his self-description as follows: As a CD enthusiast, I've come to realize that my true passion lies in the high-octane, energetic rock 'n' roll that albums like 'Powerage' embody. I'm drawn to immediate, catchy rock anthems with a vibrant and powerful sound that AOR CDs consistently deliver. This recent discovery complements my past love for the raw energy and catchy guitar riffs found in albums like AC/DC's 'High Voltage'. While I still appreciate iconic and historically significant music, I now favor CDs that offer a consistent intensity and engaging rock experience over those with a more diverse or mellow sound. I steer clear of CDs, such as 'Beatles For Sale', that may not consistently match the energetic and unapologetic spirit of rock that I adore. 

The positive CD has the following updated information: 'Powerage - Classic Rock; AOR. A high-intensity rock album with energetic guitar riffs and catchy anthems, perfectly suited for enthusiasts of vibrant, engaging rock 'n' roll.'
