The recommender system made unsuitable recommendation. 
 Its reasons are as follows: From my self-introduction, it is clear that I enjoy listening to CDs very much, but no specific preferences or dislikes are mentioned. Given this, I will base my decision on common knowledge and the features of the two CDs.
'We Can't Dance' is categorized as 'Rock; Progressive; Progressive Rock'. Progressive Rock is known for its complex and intricate compositions, often featuring long songs with diverse time signatures and unique instrumentation. This genre is typically favored by listeners who appreciate musical complexity and depth, which suggests an enriching listening experience that might be appealing to someone who enjoys CDs thoroughly.
On the other hand, 'Born in the USA' falls under 'Classic Rock; Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)'. Classic Rock is a more mainstream genre with a focus on memorable hooks, guitar-driven melodies, and a generally more straightforward song structure. While this can be enjoyable, it might not offer the same level of complexity and variety that a Progressive Rock album like 'We Can't Dance' could provide.
Considering the above, I choose 'We Can't Dance' because it aligns with a curiosity for the more sophisticated and less commercial aspects of rock music. The potential for a more sonically and structurally rich experience, which is often associated with Progressive Rock, makes 'We Can't Dance' the more intriguing choice for someone who listens to CDs very much. By contrast, 'Born in the USA', while a classic in its own right, may not challenge the listener to the same extent and could be perceived as a more casual listen, which might not fully satisfy the enthusiasm I have for CDs.

This preference for a diverse range of familiar, hook-filled songs with memorable choruses has been reinforced by my recent choices. I still cherish the catchy melodies and relatable storytelling of Classic Rock and AOR, which provide a straightforward and accessible listening experience. However, I've realized my dislike for complex and intricate compositions extends to World Music that diverts from the guitar-driven tunes I adore. I seek music with a strong, recognizable impact, favoring genres like rock, oldies, and rockabilly that resonate with my desire for music that is both catchy and accessible.
